li{
    display: inline ;
   /* The bullet points disappear because when we set the display property to inline, the list items are no longer displayed as block-level elements. This means they don't have their own line, and the bullet points are not shown. Instead, they are displayed inline, one after the other, without any line breaks or bullet points.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

When display is set to block (which is the default for list items), each list item is a block-level element, which means it takes up its own line and has a bullet point.
When display is set to inline, each list item becomes an inline element, which means it doesn't take up its own line and doesn't have a bullet point.
Since the list items are now inline, they are displayed one after the other, without any line breaks or bullet points. */
